# Urban Sound Classification with CNN

The objective of this project is to implement CNN models to recognize sound events from the UrbanSound9K dataset. The work has been divided into the following notebooks:

1) Quick Data Analysis 
2) Pre-processing 
3) CNN model with Mel-Spectrogram

# Dataset

This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy. For a detailed description of the dataset and how it was compiled please refer to related [paper](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/taxonomy.html).

Classes:
A numeric identifier of the sound class:
- 0 = air_conditioner
- 1 = car_horn
- 2 = children_playing
- 3 = dog_bark
- 4 = drilling
- 5 = engine_idling
- 6 = gun_shot
- 7 = jackhammer
- 8 = siren
- 9 = street_music
